     <p>The spraying of endsosulfan in the cashew plantations of State-owned Plantation Corporation of Kerala caused a disaster on the biodiversity of the area, a study by the Dr. V. S. Vijayan of Salim Ali Foundation shows.

A quick survey by Dr. Vijayan and his team indicates that the pesticide hit the plants and animals of the area besides causing endless human sufferings. The area showed a decline in plant diversity between 40 and 70 per cent, particularly for native species, compared to the natural habitat. Fishes were the worst hit.

In general, the area, particularly those close to the forests were rich in wildlife, birds and butterflies as reported by the local communities. In Kallar area even elephants had been reported. In Rajapuram Estate where the plantation is contiguous with forests, elephants are present even now.
