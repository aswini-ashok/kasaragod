     <p>
       There are altogether 12 rivers in kasaragod that nourish this immaculate land. Prominent among the rivers in Kasaragod is the Payaswani River. Payaswani originates from the east and merges with the Chandragiri River which is the longest among the rivers in Kasaragod. The Chandragiri River stretches up to 105 kms. The river originates from Chandragupta Vasti where the great Maurya Emperor Chandragupta Maurya is believed to have spent his final days as a sage, and hence the name Chandragiri river. Upppala, shiriya, kumbala, megral, bekal, chithari, karyankodu are the other rivers. Karyankodu is the second largest river with 64 km length. A dam has been built across the river at Kakkadavu. These rivers provide ample facilities for irrigation.
